// Barrel for the Firebase service layer. The implementation is split by aggregate under
// services/firebase/ (core init + authority, accounts, media, trees, spaces, governance, pulses,
// watering, engagement); this file re-exports them all so every existing
// `../services/firebase` import keeps working unchanged. Prefer importing from the specific
// aggregate module in new code.
